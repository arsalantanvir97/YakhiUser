                    Everyone keeps asking me how I am healing diseases so
                    effectively and so fast. My reply is simple, I don’t heal
                    anything. YHWH (GOD) created the fleshly vehicle (body) to
                    heal itself if the MIND allows it. As long as you are eating
                    and consuming what your body was designed to digest, you can
                    over come any Illness. However, sometimes we need an extra
                    healing boost from God’s Miracle Electric Plants we call
                    Alkaline Herbs!

                    It’s Vitally important that we inner-stand cosmic
                    arrangement, genetic predisposition, and their connection to
                    diet, disease and healing. Your liver grounds your brain,
                    your heart pulsates an electric magnetic field, your pineal
                    gland produce carbon, your pituitary gland produces copper,
                    and they all create an electrical spiral force in your
                    nervous system. You Are An Electrical Living Being.
                    Therefore you were designed to eat Electrical Living Foods.
